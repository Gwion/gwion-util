# Gwion-utils

Provides common common utility, and lexer/parser/preprocessor for [Gwion](https://github.com/fennecdjay/gwion)
Meant to be used as a gwion submodule, and to help develop tooling.

## TODO
  * [ ] make two (static) libraries
    + gwion_util
    + gwion_ast (depends on the former)
  * [ ] testing
